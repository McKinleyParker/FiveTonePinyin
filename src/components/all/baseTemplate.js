        <h2>What is Pinyin</h2>
        <h3>And why do we need it?</h3>
        <p>
          Pinyin is the Romanization of the Chinese characters based on their
          pronunciation. In Mandarin Chinese, the phrase “Pin Yin” literally
          translates into “spell sound.” In other words, spelling out Chinese
          phrases with letters from the English alphabet.

        <h2>The History of Pinyin</h2>
        <h3>Has Chinese Always Had Pinyin?</h3>
        <p>
          Historically, Pinyin started as a means of explaining Chinese to
          Western learners. It wasn’t until the Qing Dynasty that Chinese people
          really started considering adopting a form of spelling in their
          writing system. According to some scholars, the beginnings of Pinyin
          were derived after the Chinese observed the Romaji system and Western
          learning in Japan.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Chinese government did not officially recognize this language form
          until the 1950s, when it became a project headed by Zhou Youguang and
          a team of linguists. It was then introduced in elementary school in
          order to improve literacy rates as well as help standardize the
          pronunciation of Chinese characters.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the digital age, Pinyin has become exceedingly useful, as it is the
          most popular and common way to type out Chinese characters on a
          typical keyboard. Touch-screen devices allow you to draw out the
          character, which is often unreliable (depending on how bad your
          handwriting is) and more time consuming.
